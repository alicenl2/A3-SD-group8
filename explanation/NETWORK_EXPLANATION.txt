# Docker Networking Configuration Documentation

## 1. Subnet and Static IP Range Selection
- Subnet Configuration: 192.168.1.0/24
  - Provides 254 usable IP addresses (192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254)
  - Reserved IPs:
    * 192.168.1.0: Network address
    * 192.168.1.1: Typically gateway
    * 192.168.1.255: Broadcast address
- Static IP Assignments:
  * Web Application (roulette_web): 192.168.1.2
  * Database (roulette_db): 192.168.1.3
- Justification:
  * Class C private network (192.168.0.0/16) is ideal for small to medium deployments
  * /24 subnet provides ample addresses for future service scaling
  * Static IPs ensure consistent service discovery and networking stability

## 2. Subnet Overlap Considerations
- Potential Issues:
  * Host Network Conflicts: If host machine uses 192.168.1.0/24, container networking fails
  * VPN Conflicts: VPN connections might use overlapping private ranges
  * Router/Gateway Conflicts: Local network infrastructure may use similar ranges
- Impact Prevention:
  * Chosen subnet (192.168.1.0/24) should be unique across:
    - Host network interfaces
    - VPN configurations
    - Local network infrastructure
  * Consider using less common ranges (e.g., 172.16.0.0/12) if conflicts occur

## 3. Docker DNS Resolution
- Internal DNS Server:
  * Docker daemon runs an embedded DNS server (127.0.0.11)
  * Automatically registers container names as DNS records
  * Enables service discovery using container names
- Resolution Process:
  * Container-to-container communication uses DNS names
    - 'db' resolves to 192.168.1.3
    - 'web' resolves to 192.168.1.2
  * DNS updates automatically handle container restarts
- Benefits:
  * Service discovery without hardcoding IPs
  * Supports container scaling and replacement
  * Enables zero-downtime deployments
